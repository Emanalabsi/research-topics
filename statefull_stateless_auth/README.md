# Overview of Stateless vs Stateful Authentication:

### Authentication

**Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system before granting access to a resource. Stateless and stateful authentication are two different approaches to this process, and each approach has its own set of advantages and disadvantages**



### Authorization
***Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to a resource or system based on a user's identity, permissions, and other factors. It is typically implemented after authentication and ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources or perform specific actions. Access control lists (ACLs) and role-based access control (RBAC) are common methods of implementing authorization.***


# http protocol state

***HTTP protocol is stateless, which means that each message exchange between a client and a server is independent and self-contained. The server doesn't keep any information about previous requests or the client's state, so every request needs to contain all the necessary information. This ensures that the protocol is simple and scalable, but it also means that the server can't assume anything about the client's state or the previous requests it made.***

## Exploring Authentication Methods in HTTP: Stateless vs Stateful:

# Stateless
***Stateless authentication involves sending authentication information (usually a token) with each request, and the server doesn't store any session information. This approach is simple and scalable because it doesn't require the server to maintain session information.***

## scenarios:
- Microservices architectures, where each service is responsible for handling its own authentication and doesn't rely on a centralized session store

- A social media application with a large user base across multiple regions needs to handle a high volume of traffic. By using stateless authentication, the application can simplify its architecture and scale horizontally to handle the increased traffic without worrying about session state management. This allows the application to quickly respond to requests from any geographic region without the latency and coordination overhead of a centralized session store


# StateFull:

***Stateful authentication involves creating a session for the user when they log in, and the client sends a session ID with each subsequent request. The server uses the session ID to look up the user's session and determine if they are authenticated.***

## scenarios:

- Imagine a banking application that needs to maintain session state for each client. In this scenario, stateful authentication can be beneficial as it allows the application to maintain a consistent view of the client's session across multiple requests. This allows the application to implement features such as transaction history and fraud detection by analyzing the user's behavior over time.

- Consider an e-commerce application that requires users to maintain a persistent shopping cart across multiple sessions. Stateful authentication can be beneficial in this scenario as it allows the application to store the user's shopping cart information in a centralized session store, making it accessible across multiple devices and sessions. This allows the user to pick up where they left off regardless of which device they're using to access the application
