# OAuth

## Authentication vs Authorization

The process of confirming a user's or system's identification is known as authentication. In other words, it involves figuring out if a person is who they say they are. Usernames and passwords, biometric elements (such fingerprints or face recognition), smart cards, or other authentication techniques are typically used to achieve authentication.

After a user has been authenticated, authorization is the process of deciding what actions are permitted of them. To find out if a person is authorized to utilize a specific resource or carry out a specific operation, this often entails verifying their permissions, roles, or access control lists.




## 1. What Is OAuth and Why to use?
OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. This mechanism is used by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter to permit users to share information about their accounts with third-party applications or websites.
